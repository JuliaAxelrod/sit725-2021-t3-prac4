Readme BY Julia Axelrod, replacing Readme by Dr. Alessio Bonti

What I did in this assignment:

Used boilerplate code and styles.css provided by Dr. Alessio Bonti to begin the project

Project is located in node-material folder and includes
server.js and public folder, containing env.js, index.html and styles.css as well as folder assets with images, wireframe design document and homepage HTML.

What I changed and implemented:
Changed visual representation of index.html
Added my images from Antarctica
Chaged code:

in Server.js I changed port for internal reasons

- added global variable for future login
- added setTimeout to produce socket.id in socket.emit
- changed /test to output different message depending on user accessing it before or after setTimeout

In env.js I added

- append all projects to project list
- function to output allprojects on cards - for HTML
- added jQuery for sidenav intitialisation.

In future, I will add jQuery to initialise datePicker in this file

Index.html was modified visually to suit presentation of Antarctica views, but reference to Dr. Alessio Bonti was kept.

- datePicker was added to link to future projects for logging of expedition events
- menu was added with link to my homepage "Antarctica"
- div for project list was added
- datePicker was initialised using <script></script>, but in future will be moved to env.js to be initalised in jQuery

In styles .test-div div style was added for presentation of 20 projects in table

- Upload to gitHub was very chaotic, as I was unsure how to add a folder, I may need to re-do the upload.
- Added wireframe design file Wireframe for Antarctica website project SIT725 Prac 3.pdf

Kind Regards,
Julia
